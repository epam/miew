# Miew 3D Molecular Viewer - Repository Instructions

## Project Overview

Miew is a high-performance web tool for advanced visualization and manipulation of molecular structures. It provides a full-featured set of tools for 3D visualization and editing of small molecules as well as large molecular complexes, including means to view, analyze, and modify the 3D structure of a molecule.

The project works as a standalone web application or integrates as a component into web pages. It targets the latest versions of WebGL-enabled desktop (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and mobile (iOS, Android) browsers.

## Monorepo Structure

This is a Yarn monorepo organized as follows:

- **Root level**: Contains monorepo configuration, shared tooling, and documentation
- **packages/miew**: Core JavaScript library with the 3D molecular viewer, including docs, examples, and old demo application
- **packages/miew-react**: React.js wrapper component for easy integration
- **packages/miew-app**: New demo application built with React with the goal to replace the old demo application (work in progress)

Note that the core library (`miew`) is framework-agnostic and does not depend on React or any other UI framework. It started in 2015 and can be considered as a legacy-style JavaScript library. It implements its own mutable state management. Other packages (`miew-react`, `miew-app`) are built with modern React best practices.

### Key Directories

- `/packages/miew/src/`: Core library source code
  - `/chem/`: Chemistry-related classes (Complex, Atom, Bond, etc.)
  - `/gfx/`: Graphics rendering (modes, colorers, materials, shaders)
  - `/io/`: File input/output (loaders, parsers for PDB, SDF, etc.)
  - `/ui/`: User interface components and controls
  - `/utils/`: Utility functions and helpers
- `/packages/miew/demo/`: Old demo application assets and scripts
- `/packages/miew/examples/`: Usage examples and integration samples
- `/packages/miew/test/`: Unit and E2E tests

- `/packages/miew-react/src/`: React component wrapper
- `/packages/miew-react/types/`: Type definitions for use by TypeScript projects
- `/packages/miew-app/src/`: New React-based demo application

- **Selenium WebDriver**: E2E testing

### Testing and Quality (miew-app, miew-react)
- **Jest**: Test runner and assertion library
- **React Testing Library**: React component testing

## Coding Standards and Conventions

### JavaScript/ES6+
- Follow **Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide** via ESLint configuration
- Use ES6+ features: arrow functions, destructuring, template literals, modules
- Use `import`/`export` for modules (no CommonJS in source)
- Prefer `const` and `let` over `var`
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Comment complex algorithms and mathematical computations

### React/JSX (for React packages)
- Use functional components with hooks when possible
- Follow React best practices for state management
- Use JSX for component rendering
- Implement proper prop validation

### File Naming
- Use PascalCase for class files and React components: `ComplexVisual.js`, `AboutPanel.jsx`
- Use camelCase for utility files and modules: `gfxutils.js`, `meshutils.js`
- Use lowercase with hyphens for CSS/SCSS: `main.scss`, `tools-panel.scss`

### Code Organization
- One class per file for major components
- Group related functionality in modules/directories
- Use barrel exports (`index.js`) for clean imports
- Keep test files adjacent to source files with `.test.js` suffix

## Development Workflow

### Git Commit Messages
Follow these guidelines for writing clear and consistent commit messages:

- **Capitalize and use imperative mood**: Start with a verb like "Add", "Fix", "Update", "Remove"
- **Keep subject line concise**: Aim for 50 characters or less
- **Separate subject from body**: Use a blank line between the subject and detailed description
- **Focus on what and why**: Explain what changed and why, not how it was implemented

Examples:
```
Add support for CIF file format

Implement parser and loader for Crystallographic Information File
format to support crystal structure visualization. This addresses
user requests for broader file format compatibility.
```

```
Fix memory leak in molecular rendering

Properly dispose of Three.js geometries and materials when
switching between visualization modes to prevent browser
memory exhaustion with large molecules.
```

### Package Scripts
- `yarn ci`: Full CI pipeline (clean, lint, test, build)
- `yarn lint`: Run ESLint and Stylelint
- `yarn test`: Run unit tests
- `yarn test:e2e`: Run end-to-end tests
- `yarn build`: Build production bundles
- `yarn start`: Start development server
- `yarn demo`: Serve demo application

### Testing Guidelines
- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Place the unit tests in the same directory as the source files
- Use descriptive test names and organize with `describe` blocks
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Maintain high test coverage for critical paths

### Browser Support
- Target modern browsers with WebGL support
- Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- Consider mobile browser limitations
- Graceful degradation for unsupported features

## Architecture Patterns

### Core Library (miew)
- **Event-driven architecture**: Use EventDispatcher for component communication
- **Plugin system**: Modes, colorers, and materials are pluggable
- **Separation of concerns**: Clear separation between chemistry (chem/), graphics (gfx/), and UI (ui/)
- **Factory patterns**: For creating parsers, loaders, and visual representations

### Graphics Pipeline
- Uses Three.js scene graph
- Custom shaders for advanced rendering effects
- Support for multiple rendering modes (wireframe, space-filling, cartoon, etc.)
- Efficient instancing for molecular structures

### State Management
- Settings system for persistent configuration
- Immutable state updates where possible
- React Redux for React-based applications

## Performance Considerations

- Optimize for large molecular structures (10K+ atoms)
- Use GPU-accelerated rendering through WebGL
- Implement efficient picking and selection algorithms
- Memory management for large datasets
- Progressive loading for better user experience

## File Format Support

The library supports various molecular file formats:
- **PDB**: Protein Data Bank format
- **SDF/MOL**: Structure Data Format
- **GRO**: Gromacs format
- **XYZ**: Simple Cartesian coordinates
- **CCP4**: Electron density maps

When adding new format support, implement both parser and loader components following existing patterns.

## Documentation Guidelines

- Use JSDoc for API documentation
- Include examples in documentation
- Update CHANGELOG.md for user-facing changes
- Maintain README files for each package
- Write tutorials for complex features

## Security and Dependencies

- Keep dependencies updated, especially Three.js and security-sensitive packages
- Use exact versions for critical dependencies
- Review dependency vulnerabilities regularly
- Sanitize user inputs, especially in parsers

## Browser Compatibility Notes

- WebGL 1.0 minimum requirement
- Modern JavaScript features (ES6+) - no IE support
- Use feature detection for advanced WebGL capabilities
- Test on mobile devices for touch interactions
