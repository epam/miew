Miew is a high performance web tool for advanced visualization and manipulation of molecular
structures.

![Screenshot](README.png)

It provides a full-featured set of tools for 3D visualization and editing of small molecules as
well as large molecular complexes, including means to view, analyze, and modify the 3D structure
of a molecule. 

It works as a standalone HTML5 web application or integrates as a component into 
your web pages. We plan to support the [latest versions](https://browsehappy.com/) of WebGL-enabled desktop (Chrome,
Firefox, Safari, Opera, Edge) and mobile (iOS, Android) browsers.

You can find details on installation and usage of Miew component in the [library readme].
There is also a [demo application] available in the git repository.
