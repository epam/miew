All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- Replaced a Gulp pipeline with direct NPM scripts.

## [0.7.12] - 2018-02-05
### Added
- Add `Miew#exportCML()` method to retrieve a CML contents (including modified atom coordiantes) if
  a CML file was loaded.
- Add a secondary structure assignment routine: `Miew#dssp()` method and `dssp` script command.
  Available from UI too.

### Changed
- Automatic bonding uses a faster approach (voxel grid).

### Fixed
- Fix a crash in library when TextMode is used.
- Fix a couple of bugs with parameters of surface modes in UI.

## [0.7.11] - 2018-01-17
### Fixed
- Fixed a loading error in IE11 when a relative URL is used.
- Fixed an FBX export.
- Renamed files and classes to match and fixed other code smells found by SonarCloud.

## [0.7.10] - 2017-12-25
### Added
- Add more unit tests for loaders.
- Add WebVR stereo mode (still in PoC stage).

### Changed
- Refactor loaders API and switch to the new way of loader auto detection.
    - You may load electron density data by PDB ID using prefixed notation, e.g. "ccp4:3C9L"
      (the full list of prefixes is pdb, cif, mmtf, ccp4). In the case the prefix is omitted,
      it is a "pdb".
    - Another prefix is "pc" (or "pubchem") which allows loading a compound from PubChem database,
      e.g. "pc:serotonin".
    - Otherwise, the source string is assumed to contain a URL, either absolute or relative to
      the current page location.

### Fixed
- Fix loading electron density presets from a server.

## [0.7.9] - 2017-12-11
### Added
- Add an `ImmediateLoader` for loading structures from pre-fetched data.
- Add loader unit tests.

### Changed
- Sequence colorer uses white color as default for files where "sequence" is not applicable.
- CML files are parsed with default temperature of 0 and default chain id `' '` (space).
- Support different line endings in PDB format: LF, CR+LF, CR.
- Refactor parsers API and switch to the new way of parser auto detection.
- `Loader#load()` now returns a promise.
- Process a request to abort the parsing stage in a base class.
- Changed appearance of the terminal window to make it conform to the overall style and to avoid
  attempts to click on transparent areas.

### Deprecated
- Deprecated old `io.parsers` methods and `Parser.canParse()`, replaced them with alternatives.
- Callbacks in loading methods should be avoided, please use promises.

### Fixed
- Fix a crash in water bonding hack.
- Limit the number of representations correctly.
- Fix parser unit tests.

## [0.7.8] - 2017-11-27

- Fix a hangup caused by uppercase letters in terminal commands.
- Fix a picking near the terminal window border. 
- Fix incorrect formatting in terminal (upgraded jquery.terminal to v1.10.1).
- Fix surface parameter values in UI. Now they are not global and belong to a mode instance as they
  should be.
- Fix useless assignments in the code.

## [0.7.7] - 2017-11-20

Demo application was accidentally broken in this release. Hotfix is available
in [0.7.7+hotfix] and later releases.

### Added
- `Parser#parseSync()` - a synchronous method for parsing.
- Unit tests for the `Parser` class.

### Changed
- `Parser#parse()` now returns a promise.

- Callbacks in parsing methods should be avoided, please use promises.

### Fixed
- Fix a crash at non-protein molecules which contain a lone residue.
- Fix the context menu appearing when you move the molecule using right mouse button.
- Fix UI scale on mobile devices.
- Fix molecule offset on mobile devices.
- Fix theme changes from the terminal.
- Fix `Parser.checkDataTypeOptions()`, it shouldn't accept a file with a matching extension if the
  explicitly given type is different.

## [0.7.6] - 2017-11-13
### Changed
- Upgrade three.js to r87.
- Log errors as console errors instead of normal text.
- Refactor and rename private methods. Make loading pipeline implementation easier to understand.
  Public API should not be affected (yet).
 
### Deprecated

### Removed
- Remove old profiling methods.

### Fixed
- Fix a 100% crash in animation.
- Change float texture format to RGBA32F which should be available if `OES_texture_float` extension
  is present. Firefox should be able to display volumetric data now. 
- Check for floating point render target support, which is required for volumetric rendering. Note
  that the support is not available on iOS devices.
- Re-render and re-calculate the center after a file was unloaded.
- Fix warnings during shader compilation on iOS.
- Fix component movement during editing.

### Deprecated
- Old-fashioned atom labels are hidden from the UI and should not be used Use Text Mode instead.

## [0.7.4] - 2017-10-16
### Added
- Add e2e tests with golden images using Selenium WebDriver. Run `npm run e2e` or `gulp test:e2e`,
  then examine the results with `gulp show:e2e`.
