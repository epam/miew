## [0.8.2] - 2019-08-16
### Added
- The parameter `resolution` now effects image quality for Electron Density.
- Add API and terminal command to center view on selection via `miew.center`.
- Load file in Load dialog after pressing 'Enter'.

### Fixed
- Clear info panel in demo application when data haven't been loaded.
- Fix miew crash when adding representation if data was not loaded.
- Fix bug with incorrect discard behavior in component mode.
- Fix wrong scaling molecules in `DISTORTED` and `SIMPLE` stereo modes.
- Fix 'magic' rectangular lines appearing on laptops with Intel embedded GPU board.
- Fix disappearing of molecule after 'ao' turning off.

### Known issues
- Bounding box lines in Electron Density may disappear when `ao` is tuned on. 

## [0.8.1] - 2019-07-01
### Fixed
- Do not show the last pick information when selection was changed via the terminal.

  comparing results obtained on different graphics hardware. It is a big step towards distributed
  testing in cloud.

## [0.8.0] - 2019-06-07
### Added
- Add isosurface rendering for electron density maps. As volumetric rendering is still in its alpha, it is done through a global `modes.VD.isoMode` flag.

- Fix raycasting performance partially. Another fix is still in progress.

### Internal

- Use `shadow.on` setting to initialize shadowing state.
- Fix some eslint and sonar code smells.

## [0.7.23] - 2019-04-05
### Added
- Support dsn6 prefix for ED maps loading by PDB ID.
- Support non-orthogonal density volumes.
- Host full-screen viewer at a `/v` server path and add a button to launch the app from the lite viewer.
- Add an interactive example showing residue sequences.

### Changed
- Use `https` protocol for data requests.
- Implement soft shadow edges, make the colors more natural and reduce self-shadowing artifacts.
- Use URL options in the corresponding example.
- Add titles to the examples.

### Fixed
- Fix excessive rendering in case if nothing changes.
- Fix disappearing molecule after reloading the page.
- Fix full geometry rebuild when switching shadows on/off.
- Fix low performance of volumetric rendering in the case when a molecule is present in the scene.

## [0.7.22] - 2019-02-28
### Changed
- Make "fullscreen.html" example really full-screen both for desktops and mobiles.
- Add experimental sigma-coloring of volumetric maps.

### Fixed
- Fix background transparency of the terminal.
- Add a temporary workaround for jquery.terminal freeze: don't print square brackets
  into the term, replace them with parentheses
  ([jcubic/jquery.terminal#470](https://github.com/jcubic/jquery.terminal/issues/470)).
- Fix rendering conflicts when `ssao=true` and `fxaa=false` at the same time.

### Internal
- Enforce better ES2015+ with the newer eslint config and fix the issues.

## [0.7.21] - 2019-02-14
### Added
- Add parsers for MOL, SDF and XYZ molecular formats and MAP, MRC and DSN6 electron density maps.
- Add experimental PDB export via `miew.save()` API.
- Molecular geometry can cast shadows now (off by default). The effect still needs
  additional effort to improve the picture and support sprite-based display modes.

### Fixed
- Fix the crash due to zero voxel grid size for very small molecules.
- Fix materials and shaders (pre-pass transparency and the backdrop material).
- Fix electron density maps rendering: now the threshold is set automatically using
  the standard deviation stored in a file or calculated over the data. Color of the
  density map is set to grayscale until further changes to the rendering code are made.

### Internal
- Migrate more parts of code to ES2015 syntax (`gfx/`, `io/`, `checm/`). 

## [0.7.20] - 2018-07-30
### Added
- Add a separate setting for fog color (`fogColor`, `fogColorEnable`) and transparency
  (`fogAlpha`). Now it can be different from the background color and only shade a
  geometry behind the far plane instead of completely hiding it.
- Add `ToonMaterial` and depth-based `outline` full-scene effect for nice
  [cartoon-like rendering][].
- Add `FlatMaterial`, `CarbonColorer`, together with `miew.motm()` API method and
  `motm` script command for reproducing the amazing
  [RCSB PDB Molecule of the Month style][] by [David S. Goodsell][].

### Changed
- Ambient occlusion (SSAO) now uses a Normal screen buffer for precise per-pixel normals.
  This requires multiple render targets output (`WEBGL_draw_buffers` extension) .

### Fixed
- Fix switching WebVR mode on and off.
- Fix wrong screenshot size on high resolution displays.
- Fix fog interpolation for sprites.
- Fix a background color not being restored from URL.

### Internal
- Migrate parts of code to ES2015 syntax (`modes/`, `colorers/`, `meshes/`, `geometries/`, `groups/`, `processors/`).
- Update golden images for e2e regression tests.

## [0.7.19] - 2018-06-18
### Changed
- Demo app uses deferred scripts loading and the stylesheet is extracted to a separate file.
- Finishing transparent background mode: fog affects transparency now, FXAA and SSAO effects support transparency too.
  Transparent materials are not fully supported in this mode due to limitations in rendering pipeline.
  See the [transparent background example](examples/transparent_background.html) for details on proper setup.

### Fixed
- Fix broken spinner after unnoticed package upgrade.
- Pin broken jquery.terminal to version 1.14, will investigate CSS issues later.

### Internal
- Use PostCSS instead of node-sass to get rid of issues with binaries and to make processing faster.

## [0.7.18] - 2018-05-29
### Added
- Add the original patented CPK palette back (`CP` identifier).
- Add the ability to specify a transparent background. Use a boolean `bg.transparent` (`false` by default).
  Some special effects are still in development (FXAA, fogging).

### Changed
- The background color is now specified via `bg.color` setting (an rgb-coded number like 0xFF0000
  for red) instead of themes. Themes are still working until the next major version.

### Deprecated
- Themes in their current implementation (`theme`, `themes.light`, `themes.dark` settings)
  are deprecated as they are related mostly to the UI and demo app, not to the miew core library.
  Use `bg.color` setting directly instead.
- Some methods of refactored lists (loaders, parsers, modes, colorers, materials, palettes) are
  marked as deprecated. Probably you didn't use them.

### Fixed
- Fix mismatched helix types in DSSP (pi- and 3/10-helices).
- Use the real list of supported file extensions in the UI instead of a hardcoded one.
- Update colorers and palettes thumbnails to better reflect the latest changes.

### Internal
- Add a base class for a lists of identifiable entities. Refactor lists of loaders, parsers,
  modes, colorers, materials, palettes to use the new class and API. Old API is deprecated
  and will be removed in the next major version.
- Update dependencies. Note that the new `jquery.terminal` would break the UI.

## [0.7.17] - 2018-05-07
### Added
- Added the Gallery menu panel with a set of predefined molecules / configurations.
- Added a Backdrop Material to the list of available materials. It should be used
  with one of the Surface Modes and the Uniform Colorer to create a background for the
  entire molecule or its parts.
- Added ability to attach a listener and get notified when a particular setting change,
  e.g. `settings.addEventListener('change:palette', myHandler)`. These events are used
  internally to process changes no matter where do they come from (menus, the terminal
  or even API).
- Added other secondary structure types beside helices and strands (turns, bends, bridges).
  Support them in MMTF and CIF format, detect them during DSSP analysis.

### Deprecated
- Deprecate `settings.override()`, use `settings.set()` instead.

### Fixed
- Fixed `utils.objectDiff()` object comparison function.
- Notice even bulk changes in settings.

### Internal
- Performed some internal class/method/property renames.
- Included building Webpack and Browserify examples into the build pipeline.

## [0.7.10] - 2017-12-25
### Added
- Add more unit tests for loaders.
- Add WebVR stereo mode (still in PoC stage).

### Changed
- Refactor loaders API and switch to the new way of loader auto detection.
    - You may load electron density data by PDB ID using prefixed notation, e.g. "ccp4:3C9L"
      (the full list of prefixes is pdb, cif, mmtf, ccp4). In the case the prefix is omitted,
      it is a "pdb".
    - Another prefix is "pc" (or "pubchem") which allows loading a compound from PubChem database,
      e.g. "pc:serotonin".
    - Otherwise, the source string is assumed to contain a URL, either absolute or relative to
      the current page location.
