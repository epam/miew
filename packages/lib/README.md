Miew is a high performance web library for advanced visualization and manipulation of molecular
structures.

![Screenshot](README.png)

It provides a full-featured set of tools for 3D visualization and editing of small molecules as
well as large molecular complexes, including means to view, analyze, and modify the 3D structure
of a molecule. It integrates as a component into your web pages.  

## Installation and Usage

Miew library is available as an [NPM] package. Install it either with NPM:

```sh
npm install --save miew
```

or [Yarn]:

```sh
yarn add miew
```

Then use it in your [Webpack] / [Browserify] / [Rollup] setup, or just test it right in the Node
environment.

```js
var Miew = require('miew');
console.log(Miew.VERSION);
```

You may also download the [minified library](dist/Miew.min.js) and access it from the browser's
`<SCRIPT>` tag, or asynchronously include it via [Require.js]. Refer to the [tutorials],
[examples] and API docs for more `details`.

There is also a [demo application] available in the git repository.
